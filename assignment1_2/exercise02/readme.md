### Round 1, exercise 2: First program

First program
-------------

#### The exercise is about the following topics:

*   Using a programming environment
*   Writing and running a simple program
*   Printing on the screen
*   Submitting the program for grading

#### Initial preparations

In PyCharm (or another IDE is possible, too, but there is only PyCharm available in the exam), create a working directory for yourself according to the instructions in the course [CS-A1113 MyCourses page](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=44394#section-0) or [CS-A1111 MyCourses page](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=44395&section=8). You can change the language of the course from the button on the left that says "Language". Create a new project with the name assignment1\_2. Then in this project create a module named "first" (the name of the module doesn't actually matter when submitting the exercise, it's just for your own organization).

#### Description of the exercise

In the module "first", write a program that prints the text  

My first program works!

#### Output of the program

The example executions are in English, but bear in mind that if you want to write names of variables or something in a print command, you should not use non-latin letters such as the scandinavian letters (A,Ä,Ö). Python programs can indeed work with these, but it is common for these programs to have problems in submitting to A+, if the student hasn't included specific text coding settings. To avoid these kind of useless annoyances, the programs to be written in this course are written without non-latin characters.

Pay close attention that the output of your program is approximately according to the example execution below (the letter case, line breaks, spaces, full stops, commas, exclamation points or question marks are not checked even though they might be highlighted in the test feedback.)

#### Submitting

When you have written and saved your program, run it a multiple times.

*   in PyCharm: click the code with the right mouse button and press "Run module\_name" where module\_name is the name of the module (Or: "Run File in Python Console")

and check that the output of the program is correct. When your program seems to work as it should, submit the file `first.py` to A+.

In PyCharm the files can be found by default on the left side of the window. You can drag and drop the file to submit it directly to a submission box below. In addition, you can open the file by clicking the project folder (on the left side of the window) with the right mouse button and choose "Show in Explorer".

### Example of the execution of the program:
```bash
\[Execution of the program begins\]
My first program works!
\[Execution of the program ends\]
```
